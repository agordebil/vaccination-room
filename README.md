# vaccination-room
As one of the first projects I had as a contract, this project is a UI with many indicators and a lot of buttons that bring even more indicators!
My responsibility was to make indicators work as intended without using any framework or library. It was a very basic project but it taught me so much and showed me why people tend to avoid CSS ðŸ˜…

This version doesn't have every button functioning, but the rest was almost only copy-pasta. A preview of the project:
